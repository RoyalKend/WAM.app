# Executive Summary

In November 2020 **Digitap** raised a traditional **pre-seed** round of $350K for **WAM.app** at a $3M pre-money valuation.

Launched in February 2021 as public beta **WAM** reached more than **2.5M players** in less than 2 months with 10K players tournaments and **+3.5M players** until Nov 2021 .

After this initial success we decided to create the mobile apps where to this date they have been downloaded more than **180K** times so far.

On **WAM.app**, the more a player wins the more their in-platform rank grows, just like normal real-life leaderboards in competitive sports. Once a player advances their rank they can participate in more rewarding tournaments with higher _entrance fees_ & _reward pools_.

Each tournament has a _reward pool_ where **WAM.app** adds a fixed amount of **WAM Coins** for every player who pays the _entrance fee_. At the end of the tournament the rewards are distributed algorithmically to a percentage of the top players based on their score and ranking.

**WAM.app** was nominated as a finalist at this year’s **Mobile Games Awards** in an impressive line up of companies like Niantic and Huawei.

**WAM.app** was built with one vision in mind: to be accessible on any device and platform at any time meaning it’s accessible by going to [https://wam.app](https://wam.app) or downloading the **WAM.app** from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitap.wam) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gh/app/wam-social-games/id1555705917).

We got our inspiration from real life amateur sports tournaments where millions of people from all over the world compete in games like: football, basketball, rugby, tennis, billiards, darts and many more, just to have fun and spend time together with friends and family. The pandemic showed us the importance of sharing experiences and keeping in touch with our peers and doing it on a digital platform with people from all over the globe is the simplest way to do it.

To create a multi-sided marketplace where all participants take and bring value at the same time using smart-contracts and for this we propose the following models

### &#x20;<a href="#the-mission" id="the-mission"></a>

Our mission is to ignite mass crypto adoption by building a simple to use crypto-gaming platform where users can pay with their credit-cards to get $WAM and to participate in tournaments to earn more $WAM.

### &#x20;<a href="#the-dao" id="the-dao"></a>

The future belongs to decentralised autonomous organisations. In our case, the WAM token will also become the governance token. Every WAM token owner will be able to vote for W.I.P ( WAM Improvement Proposal ) platform development proposals. Every WAM token owner will own a small part of the DAO protocol.
