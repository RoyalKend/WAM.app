**WAM.app** is available on both web (any browser or PWA) and mobile devices (iOS & Android). It was built from scratch as a powerful and capable platform that can support millions of players. We’ve invested more than 20.000 hours in research, design, development and testing while using the latest and top notch technologies available (Nuxt.js, React Native, Swift, Java, Node.js, Go and Laravel).

Moving forward this will be referred as the _“centralised”_ part. On top of it we’re now building the _“decentralised”_ version which will use blockchain technology to record ownership of tokens and allow owners to transfer / sell / use them without restriction.

We’ll integrate the _ERC-20_ token standard for our **WAM Coin** into the WAM.app stack, and also _ERC-1155 / ERC-721_ non-fungible token standards (NFTs) for the digital assets storage and trading.

There are many benefits for using Ethereum like ease of use, robustness or interoperability. However, for a platform like ours which expects relatively high TPS there’s also an important issue which is scalability (throughput).

That’s why we’ve decided to build WAM’s blockchain layer with Polygon's technology (previously MATIC).

Polygon is the most active layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution that exists in the market at the moment. It provides us low cost transactions, EVM compatibility and high speed which is required in order to build an engaging platform. With Polygon we are able to connect and most importantly develop at scale on the Ethereum network.

The power of Ethereum provides a credible layer of trust for users. By leveraging the Plasma framework on Polygon, we have significant advantages over other networks allowing scalability, security and overall better user experience.
