# Social Profiles

Each player on the platform has its own social profile which is public and can be seen by others.

Profiles have stats like general rank, country rank, number of tournaments joined and more. On **WAM.app** the player rank is calculated using its historical **WAM Coins** earnings.

Besides the rank, every player has a current **level** that starts from "_amateur_" when you first join the platform and have zero earnings and continues with "_semi-pro_", "_pro_" and "_legend_". Having a certain level means you can join tournaments that are available for that level, with bigger reward pools and more experienced players.

In order to better highlight a profile's achievements we're also gonna add **badges**. These will be received when a player does something exceptional â€“ highlighting the elevated skill levels one has.

Being a social platform also means you can add other players as friends, chat with them and in the future create clans with whom you can compete against others.
