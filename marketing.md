We will responsibly use the marketing funds in order to increase the awareness of both the **WAM Coin** and **WAM.app** platform. As marketing is a very important piece for any project, we've allocated 7% of the total WAM Coins in this category.

**Vesting**: 5% at listing, 5% in month 7, 15% every quarter after the first 12 months.
